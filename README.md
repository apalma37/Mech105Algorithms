# Mech105Algorithms
## Algorithms Created for Mech 105 class include the following:

**LU Facttorization:**
     This algorithm performs LU Factorization in a square matrix.
    
**Composite Simpsons 1/3 Rule:**
     This algorithm performs the Composite Simpsons 1/3 Rule to a vector function. It will additionally perform the Trapezoidal Rule if   there is an odd number of intervals. This function is used to integrate experimental data.
    
**False Position:** 
     This function is used to estimate the root of a function by performing the False Position Method.
